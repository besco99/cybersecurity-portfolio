Pi-hole Network Security & DNS Monitoring Project

Overview
Deployed and configured a Pi-hole DNS sinkhole on a Raspberry Pi to monitor, block, and analyze malicious and unwanted network traffic. The project focuses on DNS-level threat detection, network visibility, and traffic analysis.

Objectives
Reduce exposure to malicious domains and trackers
Gain DNS-level visibility into network behavior
Identify suspicious beaconing and anomalous traffic
Practice blue-team monitoring and investigation skills

Environment
Raspberry Pi (Raspberry Pi OS)
Pi-hole
Home LAN
Client devices (Windows, Linux)

What I Did
Installed and configured Pi-hole as the network DNS resolver
Integrated multiple threat intelligence blocklists
Monitored real-time DNS queries and client activity
Investigated suspicious domains and query patterns
Tuned blocklists to reduce false positives
Security Concepts Demonstrated
DNS traffic analysis
Network-level threat detection
Indicators of Compromise (IOC) identification
Baseline vs anomalous behavior
Defense-in-depth
Blue team monitoring

Tools Used
